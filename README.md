# GDG Cybersecurity: 3 Levels
This repository is my entry into GDG Cybersecurity's Interview Task which was broken down into 3 levels based upon the different Cybersecurity disciplines and approaches you can take to solving a Cybersecurity problem.
The main goal of the challenge was to thoroughly examine files, identify the hidden data within those files and extract human-readable data from those files through ethical and logical means.
## Task Breakdown
The challenge comprised three tasks.
- Locate hidden data in a text file
- Retrieve concealed information from a JPEG file.
- Select the appropriate QR code from a large collection and decode Base64 data.

Each task was designed to evaluate a different Cybersecurity fundamental concept.

## What Was Tested?

- Digital Forensic fundamentals and file review
- Knowledge of techniques used to hide data (steganography)
- Ability to identify encoded data (Base64)
- Ability to think logically, assess data correctly and pay attention to small details
- The ability to efficiently manage large collections of data.

## What I Used

- File analysis and String analysis
- Digital Image analysis and data extraction
- Scanning QR codes
- Base64 decoding.
